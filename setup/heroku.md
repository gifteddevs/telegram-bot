### StepWise

- **First [Fork Repo](https://github.com/mouricedevs/telegram-bot/fork) to obtain your editable repo.**
- **Navigate to gift»»cmds folder and replace the user_id(uid) and bot token with your actual bot token and user id obtained from [Bot Father](https://t.me/gifted-md) for your bot.**

### Stepwise ###

- **Create your Heroku Deployment Link by replacing "mouricedevs" with your actual github then open it on a web browser where you're logged in to heroku then deploy.**

```
https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https://github.com/your_github_username/telegram-bot
```

- **If you haven't forked the repo then it won't work for you**

- **If you've modified the repo name then it might disturb you if you doesn't know what you're doing**
